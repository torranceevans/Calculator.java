    The following code creates a MadLib. In this project, weâ€™ll use Java to write a Mad Libs word game!
    Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in with any random adjective or noun.
    The result is usually funny (or strange).

    Mad Libs require:
         - A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
         - Words from the player to fill in those blanks.
